# bhuvan-projects-base

## How to Use It

The workflow requires you to first navigate into the `startup` directory.

```bash
cd startup
```

Then, run the Makefile:

```bash
make
```

The `make` command will handle everything from inside the `startup` folder, but it will correctly install the final package `bhuvan-api.tar.gz` and create the `.env` file in your main project directory.
